In mitigation, Financial Controller Group (FCG) reconciles position balances between Risk1 and the General Ledger on a weekly basis; and Private Banking Group (PBG) Risk Management performs manual position balance checks between Risk1 and information provided by the FCG as part of their daily risk sign off within the FLOW system. Internal Audit did not find any discrepancies between the position balances in the source files and balances reflected in Risk1 as part of testing performed for a selection of one day.  Additionally, there are no formalized automated accuracy checks to validate risk measure calculations to ensure that the metrics are within acceptable thresholds for deposits and PLAs. In mitigation, Wealth Management  (WM) Strats performs an informal manual review for the risk measures generated for deposits and PLAs.  Furthermore, access to shared folders storing source data or calculated metrics for deposits, PLAs and mortgages is not restricted. As a result, users with update access to these folders can modify the risk measures calculated by the models prior to submissions into Risk1.

FIDNI is the order capture system used by the Lev Fin and FICM Syndicate teams for book-building and allocation of syndicated loans and bonds. FIDNI contains material non-public information (MNPI). The Firm s Operational Risk Policy requires that trade capture systems be registered in the SoD program to enable the Firm to identify users with incompatible access combinations across Firm systems. FIDNI s access control mechanism grants administrative privileges to all users by default. As a result, all users have privileges to grant access to any individuals listed in the Firm s corporate directory. However, Internal Audit verified that FIDNI access is restricted to Syndicate cost centers only. Finally, FIDNI s information sensitivity rating had been incorrectly classified in the Firm s technology asset inventory (TAI) system. FIDNI s MNPI flag in TAI should be set to yes and the information sensitivity set to highly restricted. Despite the error in the information sensitivity classification, FIDNI is a GCM system and as such was already subject to enhanced control procedures for protecting MNPI.

    "Comments": "(Seun Talabi) Development work to automate the single order limit updates from GLM to Speedway was completed by end of Q3 2016. The original plan was to start the deployment in Asia in Q4 and complete the deployment in EU and Americas in Ql of 2017. In Q4 of 2016, the deployment was put on hold because key coverage people in the Asia desk left the firm and we did not want to introduce additional risk related to the change. There are mitigating controls that have been put into place since 2016 to reduce the overall risk: - Automated update and control of aggregate limits have been enabled through development and deployment of inband aggregate limits controls with DLA (Dynamic Limit Allocator). Inband aggregate calculates and enforces aggregate limits for Speedway in real time for each order before sending to the exchange. With DLA, the aggregate limits management and updates are fully automated and integrated into GLM. Using the controls built around DLA, the desk has full visibility into activity in each installation of Speedway and control to update those limits as well as stopping the trading without manual intervention. - QAPM tooling has been enhanced to reduce the complexity and risk of updating single order limits. QAPM was initially using command line admins to apply the limit changes to Speedway. SAM2 (Speedway Admin Tool v2) has now been developed which allows interaction with Speedway through a simple UI driven interface. SAM2 provides an accurate and efficient way to apply limit changes to Speedway. Desk coverage has since been resolved and the deployment of new version of COCO (colocation controller) with ability to apply single order GLM updates to appropriate Speedway installations in the COLO is: - June 5 to July 21: Asia deployment - July 3 to Sep 1: EU deployment- July 10 to Sep 8: US deployment The completion date for this action will be moved to Oct 3 2017."

While ProRD management maintains a list of alternate sources for each product line, the feeds cannot be promptly swapped in the case of vendor failure. Additionally, integrating a new source in the event of a vendor failure is estimated to take approximately two to four months, depending on the complexity of setting up the vendor feed, thus exposing the Firm to a single-vendor dependency. Certain critical products may be manually maintained for a short duration; however, management has not developed a viable option to manually maintain Index/ETF products and US Equity Listed Options due to frequent updates to product composition and high data volumes respectively. The management currently does not have an alternate plan for a potential Index/ETF products reference data feed disruption.)",

    "Title": "ALP Test Case Scenarios  (Compliance reviewed a sample of ALP test cases relating to order priority logic for MS POOL and Trajectory Cross and noted the following exceptions: i. Inaccurate test case descriptions: Compliance noted that seven out of the 22 test cases reviewed had test case descriptions that did not correspond with the actual scenarios tested. The test case descriptions may be relied upon by control functions such as IED Risk and IST Risk as part of the AsiaTPG Steering process to evaluate whether adequate testing has been conducted. Although Compliance subsequently identified other test cases that covered each of the order priority logic tests at issue, inaccurate test case descriptions could lead to incorrect assumptions about the scope and extent of testing actually performed. Technology subsequently rectified the incorrect test case descriptions in February 2016. ii. Test scenarios: Compliance noted that certain test scenarios related to the handling of client orders were tested for MS POOL but were not specifically covered for Trajectory Cross. These scenarios related to prohibiting the crossing of short-sell orders for HK listed securities, as well as not permitting crosses outside of the HKEX morning and afternoon sessions. Compliance understands that the market specific logic for these rules is implemented in a common library and shared for both MS POOL and Trajectory Cross. However, as a good practice these test scenarios should also be independently tested in Trajectory Cross, together with related crossing rules and the scenarios related to order handling conditions, as stated in the ALP Guideline. iii. Incorrect test case logic: Compliance noted one test case that was incorrectly designed and hence did not test its stated objective, which was to test that orders of non-professional traders would not cross with orders submitted by professional traders. The test case was incorrectly written to submit two buy-orders, instead of one buy-order and one sell-order, and hence it did not appropriately test the stated objective. IST remediated this test case in March 2016 after Compliance identified it, and the expected result of this test in MS POOL was subsequently confirmed to be correct. The above exceptions highlight the need to enhance the Asia TPG process to ensure that test cases are appropriately designed to test regulatory-impacting changes. Controls within QAPM and IST also need enhancement to ensure that test case descriptions and test logic are reviewed for accuracy whenever changes or updates are made.)",

Business Continuity Plan (BCP) and Disaster Recovery (DR) Plan and Testing � Enterprise Data Analysis Pioneer (EDAP) team has not included the Data Network Agreement (DNA) application in the Business Impact Analysis (BIA) performed for the Business Continuity Plan (BCP). As a result, the Application Recovery Time Objective (Application RTO) of DNA, which represents the business expectations of the timeframe for recovering DNA in contingency situations, has not been determined in the Firm's BCP system (BizCon) and has not been registered downstream in the Firm's Technology Asset Information (TAI) system. In partial mitigation, the business impact of a system outage is considered to be moderate impact as production processes do not depend directly on DNA.)",

    "Title": "Client Account Data Reconciliation Inconsistencies  (Self-Identified)  ((Self-Identified) Client Reference Data (CRD) management has not adequately designed a process to ensure that reference data maintained in the mainframe is completely and correctly represented within the A2 database. Although a reconciliation report exists as a part of CRD management's ongoing monitoring activities, it is currently not comparing all fields that exist on both, mainframe and distributed A2 databases. The current design of the reconciliation report is based on remediation actions taken by CRD management for a High risk issue identified by Internal Audit in the 2013 Client Account Management - Global audit, which has been closure verified by Internal Audit previously. The present issue has manifested due to the introduction of additional fields in the mainframe environment and that the reconciliation report has not kept pace with these additions. The missing fields in the reconciliation are between the distributed A2 database and the mainframe applications, specifically ACUAIACUT and BAAC. BAAC is a mainframe CICS application within TAPS used for opening, maintaining and closing mostly Firm Trading, Pseudo and Swaps accounts. ACUAIACUT is a mainframe CICS application within TAPS used for opening and maintaining Streetside and Group Desi accounts. CRD management has identified (as of May 2017) that out of the 471 fields in the mainframe, the existing reconciliation report supports only 222 fields leaving 247 fields that are not supported at all and there are 2 fields for which there are no equivalent ones in A2. As of May 01, 2017, CRD management has analyzed the 247 fields not supported by the existing reconciliation report, and has established that 99 new fields need to be added, 110 fields need to be decommissioned, and 38 fields need further investigation before next steps can be defined. Some of the missing fields in the current reconciliation report are related to Party ID, Party Type, Credit Rating, Address, Collateral Type, EuroClear Number, Money-Laundering Requirement, Participant Tax ID, Taxpayer ID, Account Number, Account Status, FX SWIFT Fields & Tags, and Ratings (Fitch, Moody's, IBCA, S&P).)",

Additionally, periodic business entitlement reviews are not performed. Internal Audit noted the following entitlement exceptions: � 19 individuals in EMEA have inappropriate access to approve a single stage within the DX approval workflow; � 6 individuals have the ability to approve more than one stage within DX, thus bypassing the intended workflow; and � 10 out of 55 mailgroups, which control business entitlements to DX, are not marked as ACL restricted, which means that they would not be subject to a periodic review. The risk of an inappropriate trade being executed is mitigated by the manual nature of the business workflow, the involvement of multiple individuals, and the fact that one person cannot approve all stages of the workflow. In addition, Technology Management has planned to decommission the DX user interface and integrate this functionality with an existing system (Deal Blotter).)",

This audit idencified missing and ineffective controls across the areas of production data security and password management, application access management, audit logging, change testing, and disaster recovery. Specifically, Production Security � DQP production file directories that store data quality scores for key data elements, technical logs, and job scripts are not sufficiently secured, allowing any individual on the Firm's distributed network persistent access to modify directories and their content; which does not adhereto the Firm's Identity and Access Management Standard. Production access restrictions for DQP file shares have not been set correctly at time of initial setup, and are not subject to periodic review for access appropriateness.  � Production IDs that support DQP processing are not managed in accordance with the Firm's Identity and Access Management Standard, as they are not enrolled in 'No Known Password' (NKP) solution and do not rotate passwords as required (partially self-identified). In addition, IDs that are no longer used have not been decommissioned in a timely manner (self-identified). Entitlements Provisioning and Review � Although coarse-grain entitlements to DQP (e.g., read) are subject to centralized access management controls in EPR and Aveksa, the process to provision and review fine-grained entitlements that define who can propose and approve data quality rules for Wealth Management have not been established  (partially self-identified). Audit Logging � DQP does not capture an audit trail throughout the lifecycle of the data quality rule. As a result, basic forensic information such as timestamps and the user ID of the person who proposed and approved the rule are not available. Rule Testing Evidence and Validation � Rule testing results and test data outputs are not retained, and could not be evidenced. � There is no process to monitor and periodically review WM data quality rules for validity against their respective data elements, to ensure rules remain current and work as intended in case data elements change. Disaster Recovery (DR) � Results from the last DR test for DQP in 2016 have not been stored within the Firm's System Information Management and Search (SIMS) repository, as required by the Firm's Disaster Recovery Standard. In addition, while the Technical Recovery Time (TRT) for DQP is defined as >   1 week, the DR Tier rating and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) have not been defined in the Firm's BizCon and Technology Asset Inventory (TAI) applications. DQP currently supports data quality validation and monitoring for key business areas within WM, including client and account management, mortgage loan origination, Alternative Investments, and security product data maintenance. DQP usage is planned to expand further to other key business functions across Wealth Management.)",

    "Title": "Wealth  Management(WM) -Database Backup Monitoring Process (WM Technology management has not established an oversight process over the decentralized database table backups supporting Wealth Management (WM) mainframe applications, which would confirm database tables can be recovered in the event of data corruption. In addition, management has not defined data corruption scenarios that application owners should consider to assist them in planning their data recovery efforts. Within WM Technology responsibility  for mainframe application data backup and recovery planning is distributed to the application level, and ownership resides with the Primary Technology System Owner (PTSO). Each PTSO is responsible for determining the appropriate considerations for recoverability of their application data in the event, for instance, that data corruption requires restoration. Specifically Internal Audit identified that: � Approximately 56 Databases supporting 36 High risk applications do not have database backups to tape performed by Mainframe computing. The centralized Mainframe Computing database management team has a process which notifies the system owners of the existing DB2 database tables in production that have not been recently backed up and copied to tape. However, these system-generated notification alerts sent to system owners identifying instances when their database tables have not been backed up are not followed up by management and do not have system owner attestation to determine that the application owner has received and acted on the notice. Alerts were sent to the system owners for these missing tables and some of these alerts date back to 2015. It was noted in one of our samples the system owner relies on the notification to correct the backup schedules to include the missing database as the application did not have any other backup to recover from. � In addition, 17 of the 36 high risk applications Data Recovery documents in SIMS do not have data recovery procedures defined or tested to support database recovery from data corruption issues. In the WM MF Application environment system owners can either independently extract the data in the databases to a file that can be backed up, or use the back-up service provided by Mainframe Computing. However, technology management does not confirm if across both types of backup processes the applications have the required data backed up. Tape backups are not required for operational resiliency as the Firm has data center resiliency for Mainframe datacenters located in Somerset, NJ and Ashburn, Virginia allows the Firm's mainframe data to be recovered in the event of a datacenter outage. However, in the event of data corruption, the main method to recover the data would be from back-up tapes. Should backups not have all the necessary data application recovery would be hampered.)",

Also, SalesCloud would also be storing all of the client active business engagement information that is being worked with Morgan Stanley. The recently concluded SecArch case SecArch6932352 had covered the IWS data elements that were required to be encrypted while at rest. The data elements were divided into two categories that are explained below. 1. PII Information - IWS normally deals with institutional businesses. When an FA engages on a prospect, normally an FA is working closely with certain a group of individuals from that particular organization to convert the business into a client. Therefore, an FA needs to be store PII information about these individuals like their email address, physical address, phone numbers and their birth date information. This information has been agreed with business to be encrypted. 2. Business Sensitive Information- Salesforce would host IWS business information of existing clients which includes business engagement details between MS and their client. This data is sensitive from a business aspect and needs to be encrypted. Both types of data elements were agreed to be encrypted but based on latest tests by the Accenture implementation, some of the fields can't be encrypted because of salesforce out of box object limitations or some of the fields are leveraged as a formula and would impact the business usage.)",

    "Title": "Certain product builds break on AS6 (must remain on AS4) (A number of central libraries in the Algo Super Department (used by many internally developed applications) were internally written on Aquilon AS4 server builds. These librarier rely on the availability of many service configurations present only on AS4 server builds and compiling these libraries on AS6 server builds will require a large effort to debug and migrate. Current firm commitments to decommission all AS4 servers mean that the necessary development work to ensure these libraries correctly compile on AS6 server builds must be completed this year (2017). This is currently unbudgeted work and this work must be approved through the normal budget process. Moreover, the total quantity of work is sufficiently large that it may not all be allocated within one single year's budget cycle. Because multiple other applications depend on the availability of these libraries, the ability to correctly build these libraries and deploy them into PROD environments is key to a number of technology platforms across the Algo SuperDept. Compliations occur on non-PROD servers, so this risk acceptance is limited to delaying teh migration of AS4 server builds in non-PROD environments. Libraries that are successfully compiled on non-PROD AS4 server builds will operate correctly on PROD environment AS6 server builds. This risk acceptance does not encompass the delay of migrating any PROD servers to AS6, only non-PROD servers (specifcally only those servers which are needed to compile cetral infrastructure support libraries for Algo applications. The Algo technology team will continue to work through their normal project budget cycle to allocate hours to upgrading the libraries' source code trunk to a configuration that successfully compiles on AS6 server builds. When this work is complete, this Risk Acceptance will be retired.)",

    "Title": "Build- Data Integrity (Partially Self-Identified) (Data completeness and accuracy controls are not effectively operated by Wealth Management Technology to maintain client privacy preferences to disclose non-public information (opt-in/opt-out). In addition, the list of accounts used for privacy notification mailings is incomplete. The notification mailing explains the Firm's information-sharing practices to their account holders and to safeguard sensitive data. Although management has self-identified issues relating to these processes, the following gaps were noted: � WM Technology has no documentation in place to define the approximately 20 system rules and sub criteria within Client Profile System (CPS) to generate the dataset utilized for the privacy notice gap mailing process. Further, WM Technology cannot ascertain when these rules were last reviewed with the business owners to ensure that the criteria are current and relevant. Privacy Notice Mailings are sent twice a year with the initial mailing sent in September as part of the statements mailing to WM account holders. A gap mailing is the second mailing that is sent out in December to account holders that have not been captured as part of the initial mailings. WM Technology provides a list of accounts for this mailing based on the information obtained from CPS. Although a self-identified issue (ISS 1004213) identified accounts that have been excluded in the gap mailing process due to incorrect rules applied, the issue has not highlighted the completeness and accuracy of the rules sets utilized to generate this mailing as mentioned above. � Over 3,000 active accounts with privacy codes for business reasons (Privacy Code: B), for new accounts (Privacy Code: N) and for conversion from 'Vermont State Resident/Vermont Office' to 'Non-Vermont Office' (Privacy Code: X) are missing privacy flag values. The account holder's privacy preferences, to opt-in or opt-out, are driven by privacy flags defined in the Client Profile System (CPS). Since these accounts do not reflect the account holder's disclosure preferences, non-public information may be disclosed without the official consent of the account holder. Although a self-identified issue (ISS 1003006) identified illogical privacy values in CPS including 50,610 accounts missing both privacy codes and flags and 10,633 accounts with obsolete privacy flag 'T', this review identified a gap for active accounts with missing privacy flags in addition to the population of the existing issue as mentioned above.)",

Specifically, Internal Audit noted the following deficiencies related to AGCIS and Salesforce IR: AGCIS: � The directories used to store files containing tax number, name, address, etc. generated by the application prior to sending to State Street (third party vendor) are unrestricted. Additionally, IM Technology did not completely identify data attributes (i.e. social security number) considered highly restricted PII for data masking. The application utilizes the firm's Alcazar system to mask data when copied from production to non-production. AGCIS is a central repository for assets and referential data pertaining to clients, prospective business,�portfolios  and legal accounts. � Due to the current limitation of two-tier application architecture that allows front-end users to have the same level of access to the database, thirty-five business users have access to edit, modify and delete within the database. Additionally, one production ID owned by a downstream application is in 'mixed' TAM (Technology Access Management) mode that enables legacy or persistent entitlements. Salesforce IR: � The directories that are used by the application are unrestricted. Some of these directories contain PII and are also used by another application.

Salesforce IR is used to track client contacts, investment amounts and other private equity client related data. � Salesforce IR production database is incorrectly classified as Confidential instead of Highly restricted in TAI, as it contains PII such as tax number.

Internal Audit noted the lack of lack of fine grain entitlements along with lack of automated monitoring for segregation of duty (SoD) conflicts for key trading and order management applications, as well as deficiencies with application entitlement design and reviews impacting production data security and password management SoD Monitoring and Access Security. � Accelerator and Minerva applications that are used for portfolio rebalancing, bulk order generation and trading are not subject to periodic SoD conflict monitoring due to incomplete integration with the firm's central entitlement management platforms. Although manual user access assessments are being performed, users are not being assessed for conflicting access to various applications across the Firm. In addition, Management has not been performing entitlement reviews for Minerva and its user administration module LZAdmin, as required by the Firm's Information Security Policy. However, at the time of this audit, trader access to Minerva was appropriate and restricted to a small number of users. � Periodic entitlement review of external money managers' access to Money Manager Portal has not been performed in the last six months, as per the semi-annual access review requirement. � Model Library I UMAX application used by WM Financial Advisors to manage Select UMA client portfolios has five Quality Assurance  (QA) users with full access to create/edit/delete  FA's models, as well as rebalance portfolios across all client. The same production entitlements are granted to other technology users, although their access to client accounts is restricted. Furthermore, IT users are granted access Out of Role, and are not subject to 'Special Approval', since the 'Special Approval' option for IT users is not enabled in EPR. � Two business users have inappropriate access to replay and reject traders orders in Order Transformer. Also, a user group used to grant access to OT is not appropriately linked to the OT application in EPR. Data and Production ID Security � Passwords for Select UMA production IDs are not managed in accordance with the Firm's Identity and Access Management Standard, as they are not enrolled in 'No Known Password' (NKP) solution and/or did not have password rotated as required by Technology Policy (partially self-identified).  Internal Audit also identified seven production IDs that are no longer used and have not been decommissioned; one production ID with inappropriate 'read' access to MDA database; and one ID that was incorrectly aligned to the Accelerator application in the Technology Asset Inventory (TAI) portal. � Technology users have inappropriate access to production databases, including access to 'view' PII and transaction data (self� identified). Also, business users from WM Field, Operations, Company, and other groups have direct 'read' access to production databases, while such users should be accessing data via application front-end that is subject to business entitlement controls.

    "Title": "Protection of PII Data in the A2 Database Plant (Client Reference Data (CRD) management has not adequately restricted access to PII data in the A2 database plant (EON ID - 3212), which does not adhere to certain provisions of the Firm's Identity & Access Management (IAM) Standard. Specifically, deficiencies were noted around restricting access to highly restricted data in the production environment; periodic entitlement reviews; and, the capture, retention and review of audit logs. In aggregate, these deficiencies in Identity and Access Management (IAM) controls for the A2 database plant could elevate the risk of exposure and loss of PII data stored in the A2 database plant. Internal Audit noted specific potential deficiencies as follows: � Based on the Technology Access Management  (TAM) report available from Technology Information Risk's (TIR) Risk Workstation  (riskws) (as of May 2017) - o Inappropriate access to production environment  (such as one IT user from Credit Trading and Risk Systems having persistent access to production Sybase databases, and two non-production ProiDs (a2p2qa and a2uatl) having access to production Sybase databases); o Inappropriate access to non-production environment  (such as production ProiDs having access to non-production environment); o Incomplete adoption of TAM attributes as defined in the riskws report (such as mapping of database objects, legacy IT and business user logins, existence of public group objects, and existence of non-Kerberized authentications); and, o Incomplete periodic entitlement reviews (such as missing production ProiDs) (Note: For the above exceptions, Internal Audit noted that the Risk Workstation data requires reconciliation with other tools implemented by TIR, in order to provide a mechanism for comprehensive and sustainable monitoring of identity and access management aspects for the A2 database plant. As part of Internal Audit's 2017 Technology Entitlements and Privileged Access audit, in progress, Risk Workstation will be examined in greater detail by Internal Audit. The issues raised here are specific to the A2 database plant and remediation efforts by CRD management will be focused only on the A2 database plant.) � Ineffective capture, retention and review of audit logs for Privileged IT Access (PIA) users. This includes the inability to log aspects of successful and unsuccessful actions, and the use of shared identities. In partial mitigation, certain database level logs do exist, along with application-level  logs in the front-end A2 systems (grouped under EOD ID - 3211) such as Darwin, but it will be difficult to use these logs on an ongoing basis to attribute and review PIA user actions.)",

Consequently, CRD management was unable to demonstrate effective management oversight over the fine-grained protection of PII data in the production environment; and, � A user analysis has not been conducted and policies have not been defined for the A2 database plant regarding the access of Trusted Applications, which are not under the remit of RDE, and which could have access to PII data, including data stores such as the CRD Object Cache.
